### Features & Functionality

- This app is a Single Page Application.
- It gives the user a smooth UX to explore as it does not reload when navigating through different routes
- There is an authentication system, reset password developed via firebase and [react-firebase-hooks](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks)
- Authentication is done with email-password and google.
- I also used React Toastify to notify the user about password reset email sent.
- There is a protected route when user click on checkout button on services.
- If not logged in user can't go to the checkout page. After logging in user is redirected to the destined page.
